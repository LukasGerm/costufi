# Costufi
This documentation is still in work.
### Description
Costufi is a free, Open Source, node.js based application for user management especially for photographers.
You can easily creat assignments and upload pictures for your customers, so they can look at it and download it.
At this time, it's only in german, but in one of the next updates I will create an english-language-support.
### Installation
Unstable Version
I look forward to create an installer, that you don't have to do this.
